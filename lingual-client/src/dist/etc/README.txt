Lingual @releaseVersion@

Lingual is true SQL for Cascading and Apache Hadoop.

Lingual includes a JDBC Driver, SQL command shell, and a catalog manager for creating schemas and tables.

To use Lingual, there is no installation other than the optional command line utilities.

Lingual is based on the Cascading (http://cascading.org) distributed processing engine and
the Optiq (https://github.com/julianhyde/optiq) SQL parser and rule engine.

See the docs directory for details on using the included command line utilities.
