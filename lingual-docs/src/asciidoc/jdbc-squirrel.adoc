## Using JDBC with Squirrel SQL with Apache Hadoop

The Lingual Drivers work great with http://squirrel-sql.sourceforge.net[Squirrel SQL] as a desktop client.

Here we will describe installing the Lingual Driver for the Apache Hadoop platform. The local mode platform should
be straightforward as it has less configuration.

Before starting, make sure:

 * the Lingual Client has been downloaded and installed per the<<getting-started,Getting Started>> section,
 * a local copy of the Apache Hadoop libraries are unpacked, and
 * a copy of the remote Hadoop cluster configuration is copied local (found in the remote `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`)

After downloading the Squirrel application and installing, simply add a new "driver" from the drivers tab.

The "name" is arbitrary, "Lingual Hadoop" is a good place to start.

The "example url" should be `jdbc:lingual:hadoop`.

After clicking "extra classpath", navigate and add:

 * All the `jar` files found under the Apache Hadoop unpack directory, including the `lib` folder
 * The directory containing all the Hadoop configuration files (`HADOOP_CONF_DIR`)
 * The Lingual Hadoop JDBC jar file, found under `lingual-client/platform/hadoop/lingual-hadoop-x.y.z-jdbc.jar`

Finally, if not already filled out, set "class name" to `cascading.lingual.jdbc.Driver` then click "Ok".

Next click the "Aliases" tab and create a new alias using the driver name just created. The name is arbitrary here
as well.

"username" should be the name of the user in which the default directory on HDFS should be accessed. If using
the vagrant test cluster, set the username to "vagrant". This will pull all catalog and meta-data from the
`/user/vagrant` director on HDFS. No password is necessary.

Save any any changes and connect to the cluster.

If the <<getting-started,Getting Started Guide>> was followed, you can now query any data that was previously
registered by `lingual catalog` tool.
