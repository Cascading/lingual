# Lingual - SQL for Cascading (on Apache Hadoop)

Lingual executes ANSI SQL queries as Cascading applications on Apache Hadoop clusters.

|===========================================================

## Overview

Lingual includes JDBC Drivers, SQL command shell, and a catalog manager for creating schemas and tables.

If you are already familiar with Cascading, you can use a Cascading like API to run SQL based `Flow`s in tandem with
other custom `Flow`s in your application.

To use Lingual, there is no installation other than the optional command line utilities.

Lingual is based on the http://cascading.org[Cascading] distributed processing engine and
the https://github.com/julianhyde/optiq[Optiq] SQL parser and rule engine.

Lingual only supports `SELECT` and `INSERT INTO` statements, for example

    SELECT COUNT( DISTINCT CITY ), SUM( DISTINCT AGE ) FROM SALES.EMPS

    INSERT INTO TEST.RESULTS SELECT EMPNO, NAME FROM SALES.EMPS

DDL statements like `CREATE TABLE` are unsupported via the JDBC Driver interface. See the <<catalog,Lingual Catalog>>
tool for defining Schemas and Tables from the command line.

### Command Line Tools

Use the command line tools to publish files as tables, or run queries from the console, locally or
on Amazon ElasticMapReduce.

To install:

  * <<install,Installation>>

The Lingual command line client consists of two utilities:

  * <<catalog,Catalog>>
  * <<shell,Shell>>

See the <<getting-started,Getting Started>> page for an overview of how the utilities work together.

When using Apache Hadoop, refer to the notes on how to setup your Hadoop environment:

  * <<hadoop,Using Hadoop>>

### Java JDBC

Lingual provides a fully Java JDBC compliant Driver.

  * <<jdbc-java,A Java JDBC Example>>
  * <<jdbc-r,Accessing Data from R>>
  * <<jdbc,Using the Driver>>

### Java Cascading APIs

Lingual provides a very simple API for executing a SQL statement as a Cascading Flow.

  * <<java, A Java Example>>

### Data Providers

*Data Providers* are `jar` files with custom Cascading Taps, Schemes, a factory class, and a provider definition file
(`provider.properties`).

When registered with the Lingual Catalog tool, the Lingual JDBC Driver and/or Lingual Shell can run queries where data
is read or written to systems the `provider` provides integration to.

A provider can be specified by either referencing the file location, or using a Maven style spec (`group:name:revision`).
