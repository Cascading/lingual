## Notes on using with Apache Hadoop

When using with Apache Hadoop, the Shell expects the following environment variable so that the correct Hadoop
version and configuration may be included in the CLASSPATH.

  * `HADOOP_HOME` - path to local Hadoop installation
  * `HADOOP_CONF_DIR` - defaults to `$HADOOP_HOME/conf`
  * `HADOOP_USER_NAME` - the username to use when submitting Hadoop jobs

### AWS EMR

If working with a remote Amazon Elastic MapReduce cluster from a local terminal/shell, see the
https://github.com/cwensel/bash-emr[Bash EMR] utilities, specifically the `emrconf` command to fetch remote
configuration files locally that can be pointed to with `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`.

If errors are encountered executing SQL queries remotely, calling:

    > export HADOOP_USER_NAME=hadoop

Should alleviate any security issues causing failures on the remote EMR Cluster.
