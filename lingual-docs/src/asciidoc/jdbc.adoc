## Using the JDBC Drivers

Lingual provides two JDBC Driver jars with self contained dependencies in the http://conjars.org[Conjars] Maven
repository.

The JDBC connection string is of the form `jdbc:lingual:[platform]`, where `[platform]` is either `local` or `hadoop`.

Additional JDBC properties may be set using the form:

    jdbc:lingual:[platform];[property]=[value];[property]=[value];...

Where the property keys are, in part:

  * `catalog=[path]` - the working directory where your .lingual workspace is kept, default is `./`.
  * `schema=[name]` - set the default schema name to use
  * `schemas=[path,path]` - URI paths to the set of schema/tables to install in the catalog on startup
  * `resultPath=[path]` - temporary root path for result sets to be stored, defaults to `./results`
  * `flowPlanPath=[path]` - for debugging, print the corresponding Flow dot file here
  * `sqlPlanPath=[path]` - for debugging, print the corresponding SQL plan file here

`platform` is required to help the driver distinguish between either backend when more than one JDBC Driver is in
the CLASSPATH.

Any other properties will be passed down to the underlying platform. In the case of Apache Hadoop, specific
connection properties can be passed. See the <<hadoop,Notes on Hadoop>> documentation for more details.

### Using the JDBC Driver In Your Project

To pull either of these jars, the `jdbc` Maven classifier must be used if you want the self contained `jar` file with
all its _shaded_ dependencies.

For the `local` mode platform:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>cascading</groupId>
      <artifactId>lingual-local</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
      <classifier>jdbc</classifier>
    </dependency>

For the `hadoop` mode platform:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>cascading</groupId>
      <artifactId>lingual-hadoop</artifactId>
      <version>x.y.z</version>
      <classifier>jdbc</classifier>
    </dependency>

Alternatively, pulling the default artifacts (without the classifier) will also pull any relevant dependencies as
would be expected.
